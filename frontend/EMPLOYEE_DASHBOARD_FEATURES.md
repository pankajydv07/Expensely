## 🏗️ Architecture

### Component Structure
```
EmployeeDashboard (Page)
├── Header (App bar with user info)
├── Statistics Cards (5 summary cards)
├── Actions Bar (Filters + New Expense buttons)
├── Filters Panel (Collapsible search/filter section)
├── Tabs (Status-based navigation)
├── ExpenseTable Component
│   ├── Table with all expenses
│   └── Actions menu per row
└── Dialog
    └── ExpenseForm Component
        ├── All input fields
        ├── File upload
        └── Action buttons
```

### Data Flow
1. **Page Load**: Fetch expenses from API via Redux
2. **User Action**: Dispatch Redux action (create/update/delete/submit)
3. **API Call**: Redux thunk makes async call to backend
4. **Update State**: Redux updates global state
5. **Refresh Data**: Component refetches to get latest data
6. **User Feedback**: Snackbar notification shows result

### Redux Actions Used
- `fetchExpenses()` - Load all expenses
- `createExpense(formData)` - Create new expense
- `updateExpense({ id, data })` - Update existing expense
- `submitExpense(id)` - Submit for approval
- `deleteExpense(id)` - Delete expense
- `setFilters(filters)` - Update filter state
- `fetchCategories()` - Load categories for form

## 🚀 What's Ready

### Frontend ✅
- Complete expense management UI
- All CRUD operations implemented
- Advanced filtering and search
- Receipt upload with validation
- OCR infrastructure (needs backend endpoint)
- Statistics dashboard
- Responsive design
- Error handling and notifications

### Backend Needed 🔧
To make this fully operational, you'll need to implement:

1. **Expense API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/expenses` - List expenses for current user
   - `POST /api/expenses` - Create new expense
   - `PUT /api/expenses/:id` - Update expense
   - `DELETE /api/expenses/:id` - Delete expense
   - `POST /api/expenses/:id/submit` - Submit for approval

2. **Category API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/categories` - List all categories

3. **File Upload Endpoint**:
   - `POST /api/upload` - Handle receipt uploads
   - File storage (local/S3/cloud)

4. **OCR Integration** (Optional):
   - `POST /api/ocr/extract` - Extract data from receipt image
   - Integration with OCR service (Google Vision, AWS Textract, etc.)

5. **Currency Exchange** (Future):
   - `GET /api/exchange-rates` - Get current exchange rates
   - Auto-conversion to company currency

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Creating an Expense
1. Click "New Expense" button
2. Fill in required fields (title, date, category, amount)
3. Optionally add description
4. Upload receipt (optional)
5. Click "Create Expense"
6. Expense saved as Draft status

### Submitting for Approval
1. Find draft expense in table
2. Click 3-dot menu button
3. Click "Submit for Approval"
4. Status changes to "Pending"
5. Manager can now review

### Filtering Expenses
1. Click "Filters" button to expand filter panel
2. Enter search text or select status
3. Table updates in real-time
4. Or use tabs for quick status filtering

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Implement backend API endpoints
2. Connect frontend to real API (update `baseURL` in axios config)
3. Test with real data
4. Add authentication tokens to API calls

### Future Enhancements
- Expense detail view page
- Bulk operations (select multiple, bulk submit/delete)
- Export expenses to CSV/PDF
- Expense analytics and charts
- Mobile app
- Email notifications
- Approval workflow visualization
- Expense policies and limits
- Department/project assignment

## 🐛 Known Limitations
- OCR feature placeholder (needs backend integration)
- No pagination (loads all expenses at once)
- Currency conversion manual (needs exchange rate API)
- Receipt preview doesn't support all PDF types
- No offline mode

## 📚 Dependencies
- React 18+
- Redux Toolkit
- Material-UI v5
